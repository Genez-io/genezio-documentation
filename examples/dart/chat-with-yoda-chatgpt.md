# chat-with-yoda-chatgpt

### You can check [a beta chat application integrated with Chat GPT here](https://chat-with-chatgpt.dev.app.genez.io/).

Welcome to our demo chat app integrated with Chat GPT, written in Flutter (frontend), Dart(backend), MongoDB as a database, and deployed [genezio](https://genez.io/).

This app allows users to engage in conversations with a chatbot powered by Chat GPT. This app is meant to be a demo for a technical talk on the topic of building full-stack apps with Dart and genezio.

### Clone the example

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/Genez-io/genezio-examples`
2. Navigate to the folder `cd ./genezio-examples/dart/chat-with-yoda-chatgpt`
