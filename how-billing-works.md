# How Billing Works

This document describes how billing works for genezio's services.

### How to upgrade to paid

If you want to subscribe to one of genezio's premium plans, you can easily go to genezio's [billing page](https://app.genez.io/billing/) from the Dashboard App and press **Change Plan**. Select the most suitable plan for your needs and then you will be redirected to [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) where you will enter your credit card information.

You will be redirected to the genezio dashboard and will have premium features from now on.

If there will be any problems, you will be redirected to the genezio billing page where you can restart the payment process.

### Payment Methods

genezio accepts the following payment methods provided by Stripe:

* Credit card
* Debit card
* Apple Pay
* Google Pay
* Link

### Billing Cycle

The billing cycle starts on the day you subscribe, and we will send you an invoice on the same day each month. Payment will be charged automatically to your credit card.

### Cancellation

You can cancel your subscription at any time from our [billing page](https://app.genez.io/billing/), but you will have premium access till the end of the billing period.
