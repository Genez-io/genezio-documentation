# JSON-RPC Methods

JSON-RPC is the default way of invoking the methods in genezio. JSON-RPC methods use the  [JSON-RPC 2.0 specification](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification). When a method is declared as JSON-RPC, it can have any number of parameters and it can return any type. This is an example of a class containing a JSON-RPC method.

Javascript:

```javascript
export class HelloWorldService {
  hello(name, from) {
    console.log(`Hello world request received with name ${name} from ${from}!`)

    return `Hello, ${name}, from ${from}!`
  }
}
```

After the code is deployed using `genezio deploy` or when testing locally using `genezio local`, the method can be called using the autogenerated SDK.

Javascript:

```javascript
await HelloWorldService.hello("World", "genezio")
```

The SDK will compose the JSON-RPC request and it will send it to the deployed function.
