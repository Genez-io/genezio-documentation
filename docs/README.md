## Genezio Overview

On top of the FaaS, it features a typesafe backend-as-a-service (BaaS), ensuring type-safe communication between your backend and frontend, which means fewer bugs and smoother development.

With Genezio Typesafe, you get out-of-the-box authentication, easy project configuration using decorators, and built-in rate limiting. These tools streamline your workflow, so you can focus on coding and building great applications without the hassle. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, Genezio has you covered.
