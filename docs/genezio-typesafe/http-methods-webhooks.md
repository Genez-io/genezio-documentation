# HTTP Calls / Webhooks

<head>
  <title>HTTP Calls / Webhooks | Genezio Documentation</title>
</head>
Genezio provides an easy way to interact with third-party services or APIs using webhooks/HTTP methods.

With genezio decorators, you can set one or more of your methods to handle HTTP requests.

## Use webhooks in your project

A webhook/HTTP method is declared in the same way as any other genezio method, but it needs to fulfill the following requirements to be considered a webhook/HTTP method:

- The method must be marked as `http` either using [decorators](/docs/genezio-typesafe/genezio-decorators) or the [`genezio.yaml` configuration](/docs/project-structure/genezio-configuration-file.md) file.
- The method must have only one parameter of type [`GenezioHttpRequest`](#geneziohttprequest).
- The method must return a [`GenezioHttpResponse`](#geneziohttpresponse) object.

:::info
Decorators are only supported in TypeScript, JavaScript and Go. If you are using any other supported language, you need to specify the method as a HTTP method in the `genezio.yaml` file.

    export class HttpServer {
        @GenezioMethod({ type: "http" })
        handleSimplePlainRequest(request: GenezioHttpRequest): GenezioHttpResponse {
            console.log(`Request received with a simple text ${request.body}!`);

            // insert your code here

            const response: GenezioHttpResponse = {
                body: request.body,
                headers: { "content-type": "text/html" },
                statusCode: "200",
            };

            return response;
        }
    }
    ```
    <Admonition type="note">
      For TypeScript and JavaScript projects, using decorators is the recommended way to declare HTTP methods, but you can also use the `genezio.yaml` file to declare the HTTP methods.

      The `genezio.yaml` is considered the source of truth for the project. If you declare two different types for the same method in the `genezio.yaml` and in the code, the type declared in the configuration file will be used.

## Deploy your service

To deploy your newly created class to the genezio infrastructure, use the following command:

```
genezio deploy
```

Usually after the deployment, you need to provide the webhook URLs to the third-party APIs or services you want to connect to.

There are 2 places where you can find the webhook URLs for your deployed methods:

1. In the [genezio dashboard](https://app.genez.io), on the corresponding project page, click on the `Logs` button on the sidebar. Here you can click on your deployed class and you will see the webhook URLs.

2. The HTTP endpoints will be shown in your terminal after executing `genezio deploy`:

```sh title="Terminal"
$ genezio deploy

Deploying your backend project to the genezio infrastructure...

Your backend code was deployed and the SDK was successfully generated

HTTP Methods Deployed:
  - HttpServer.handleSimplePlainRequest: https://<lambdaUrl>/HttpServer/handleSimplePlainRequest

App Dashboard URL: https://app.genez.io/project/<projectId>/<projectEnvId>
```

## HTTP types

### GenezioHttpRequest

#### Properties

- **headers - required:** A dictionary that contains the headers.
- **http - required:** An object that has the following properties:
  - **method:** The HTTP method.
  - **path:** The path of the request.
  - **protocol:** The HTTP version used.
  - **userAgent:** The request's user agent.
  - **sourceIp:** The IP of the source.
- **queryStringParameters - optional:** A dictionary that contains the query parameters.
- **timeEpoch - required:** Timestamp when the request was made.
- **rawBody - required:** A string with the unparsed body
- **body - required:** An object that represents the request's body. If the value is JSON, the value of this variable is a JSON object. If the value is binary, the value of this variable is a Buffer. If the value is text, the value of this variable is also text.

### GenezioHttpResponse

#### Properties

- **body - required:** An object that represents the response's body. The type of this variable can be Object, String, or Buffer.
- **headers - optional:** A dictionary that contains the headers.
- **statusCode - required:** The status code of the response.
- **isBase64Encoded - optional:** This flag can be set to `true` or `false` to indicate if the `body` is base64 encoded. This flag is optional and can be omitted.
