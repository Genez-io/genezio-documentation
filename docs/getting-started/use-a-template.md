# Use a Template

<head>
  <title>Getting Started with Genezio | Genezio Documentation</title>
</head>

Welcome! This guide will help you create your first project on Genezio by using one of our templates.

## 1. Choose a template

First make sure you have a Genezio account. If you don't have one, you can create one [here](https://app.genez.io/auth/signup).

From [https://app.genez.io/auth/login?redirect=new-project](https://app.genez.io/auth/login?redirect=new-project) you can choose a template to start your project with.

## 2. Connect your Github account

This step is optional but recommended.

By connecting your Github account, we can automatically create a repository for your project.

## 3. Deploy your project

Once you have connected your Github account, you can deploy your project by clicking the **Deploy** button.

## 3. View your project

After deploying your project, you can see the deployment link to view your project. Also, after that, you can find the link on the upper right corner of the Edit Code Page.

## 4. Edit your project

Now that your project is deployed, you can edit it. You can make changes to your project and deploy them by clicking the **Deploy** button again.

Alternatively, if you want to make changes to your project locally, you can clone the repository from Github and make changes to the project.

When you are ready to deploy your changes, you can push the changes and Genezio will automatically deploy them.

## 5. Next steps

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed your first project.

Now that you have deployed your starter project, you can explore more features of Genezio and continue building the project:

- [Custom Domains](/docs/features/custom-domain-configuration/)
- [Cron Jobs](/docs/genezio-typesafe/cron-methods/)
- [HTTP Webhooks](/docs/genezio-typesafe/http-methods-webhooks/)
