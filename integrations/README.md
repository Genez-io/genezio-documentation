# Integrations

For now, genezio integrates with GitHub by offering an easy-to-use Github Action to deploy your project in CI/CD pipeline. Check it out at [github-action.md](github-action.md "mention")

Stay tuned to our communication channels to be the first one to find out about new integrations that we are going to offer.
