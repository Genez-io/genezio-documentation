# Javascript

### Deploying a class with genezio

The main unit of deployment in JavaScript is a class. The methods of your class can be called using the following ways:

* JSON-RPC - [Learn more](../method-types/json-rpc-methods.md).
* HTTP - [Learn more](../method-types/http-methods-webhooks.md).
* Scheduled methods using cron strings - [Learn more](../method-types/cron-methods.md).

Below you can see a basic example of a JavaScript class deployed using genezio.&#x20;

```javascript
// hello.js

export class HelloWorldService {
  constructor() {
    console.log("Constructor called!")
  }

  helloWorld() {
    return "Hello world!";
  }

  hello(name, from) {
    return `Hello, ${name}, from ${from}!`
  }
}
```

Let's break down the code:

`constructor()` - this method is called once for every function instance spawned in the cloud. This method is not called for every request.

`helloWorld()` - receives no parameters and returns a string.

`hello()` - receives two parameters and returns a string.

Notice that the class `HelloWorldService` is exported. All of your exported classes will be exposed to the client using the autogenerated SDK.

### Genezio configuration file

To deploy this class, you also need a `genezio.yaml` configuration file. [Learn more](../yaml-configuration-file.md) about which configuration fields you can tweak.

```yaml
# genezio.yaml

name: hello-world
region: us-east-1
sdk:
  language: js
  options:
    runtime: node
  path: ../client/sdk/
classes:
  - path: ./hello.js
    type: jsonrpc
```
